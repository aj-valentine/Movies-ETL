# Amazing Prime - Movie Hackathon Analysis
ETL process using JSON Files, Python, Pandas, and SQL Databases

## Overview of the Amazing Prime Analysis :movie_camera:

This project was created for Britta, an analytics manager at a company called Amazing Prime. The purpose of the analysis is to develop an algorithm to predict which low budget movies being released will be the next big hit so they can buy the streaming rights. To inspire the team and connect with the local coding community, Amazing Prime has decided to create a hackathon - providing a clean set to the coders and asking them to predict the popular movies. The data set contains a scrape of Wikipedia of films that were released since 1990 and a set of rating data. Using Python and Pandas, we combined these two datasets into dataframes in order to clean up and adjust the data, then we exported the dataframes to SQL using pgAdmin 4.
